            What is usability testing?<br>

            <h4>The CMD methos that I used for thsi assignment was:</h4>

            <dd> Prototye:</dd>
            <dd> I made a prototype of my extentsion page of the project websie on paper and Figma.</dd>
            <dd> Literature study:</dd>
            <dd> To know more about the usability testing.</dd>
            <dd>
                <h4>Process and result:</h4>
            </dd>
            <dd>Usability Testing also known as User Experience (UX) Testing, is a testing method for measuring how easy
                and user-friendly a software application is. A small set of target end-users, use software application
                to expose usability defects. Usability testing mainly focuses on user’s ease of using application,
                flexibility of application to handle controls and ability of application to meet its objectives.</dd>
            <dd>As I did the user testing before for the project website I tried to follow those instruction for this
                assignment as well.
                For testing the Figma prototype, the method that I chose for this test was remote moderated tests, that
                means I did not have this ability to visit my users in person and we were physically in different places
                and I sent them the link of my prototypes to my users. Also, I did the testing in person too both for
                first test and the second one.
            </dd>
            <dd>For this assignment I tried to make the paper prototype first, I did the user testing with Figma
                prototype with three people and all of them could do the tasks correctly, I n the second step I created
                a Figma prototype for the extension website, again I did the user testing with three users.</dd>
            <dd>
                <h4>The tasks that I asked from my users to do:</h4>
            </dd>
            <dd>1. Find the instruction of return policy on page.</dd>
            <dd>Try to submite a return request on page.</dd>
            <dd>Find a way to go to the home page.</dd>
            <dd>Find the other users experiences taht buying from our website.</dd>
            <dd>Try to ask a qustion in the website.</dd>
