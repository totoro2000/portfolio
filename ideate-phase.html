            <em> " Ideation is a creative process where designers generate ideas in sessions (e.g., brainstorming, worst
                possible idea). It is the third stage in the Design Thinking process."</em><br>
            Our main goal for this phase was evluate our ideas and see what is our users expectation from our final
            product with card sorting.

                <h4>Learning outcomes:</h4>
            </dd>
            <dd>• Communication: </dd>
            <dd>We got more information from our users with card sorting.</dd>
            <dd>• Professional identity: </dd>
            <dd>We decided about the whole theme of the final product, how to sort each feature in different pages and
                the information helped us to make the prototype for the next phase.</dd>
            <dd>• Interactive media: </dd>
            <dd>Based on the ideas that we had we got feedback from users to know the strengths and weaknesses of our
                work and try to improve it and make the final work more user friendly.</dd>

            <p>
                For the ideate phase, we wanted to use the card sorting method ( from CMD methods).
            <h4> What is Card sorting?</h4>
            <dd>Card sorting is a research methodology that can help you discover how people understand and categorize
                information. In a card sort, contributors sort “cards” containing different items into groups. Card
                sorting has many applications—from figuring out how content should be grouped on a website or in an app
                to deciding how to arrange items in a retail store</dd>
            <h4>How we can use this method?</h4>
            <dd>For this assignment, we write each feature of our website on a piece of paper and we asked our users to
                sort each feature in groups and we filmed their responses. So, we get an overview from them that what
                they expect from our final product.</dd>
            <h4>Is card sorting user testing?</h4>
            <dd>A form of unmoderated usability testing, card sorting allows you to quickly spot popular groupings and
                categories so you can better speak customers' language—and meet their needs.</dd>
            <h4>Is the card sorting like the user testing and what are their differences?</h4>
            <dd>Both user testing for the prototyping and card sorting are useful ways to improve our work and make it
                more user-friendly but obviously, they are different from each other. </dd>
            <h4>Conclusion</h4>
            <dd>Before we start working on the prototyping we need to complete the ideate phase and we decided to do the
                card sorting for our project. Each member used the cards that we created before and did the test with a
                user and we record the results. The results can give us an overview for prototyping how to organize
                different parts of the website to give our users a good and easy experience while using the website. It
                can give us an idea about what users think about the final product and what they are expecting to see so
                we can do something which is aligned with their knowledge and wishes. The next step in our group project
                is to start working on the prototyping process.</dd>
