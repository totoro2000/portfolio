        <p class="note">
            For creating the persona for our group project the biggest problem that we had was a lack of information
            from our client. What’re her wishes for the website, an online shop, or a gallery, or who is exactly the
            target group of our project children or adults, how can make it playful, and for which target group? So for
            this assignment, we created two personas based on the first meeting that we had with our client, and also
            for answering all these questions we arranged an interview with Fenia( client).
            The next step for this project was thinking more about the persona and also a survey for our target group to
            make the requirements both for our client and our users clear.

                other for the museum manager.</dd>

            <dd>We all know the main subject so as a group we tried to develop our ideas about our user. What are their
                priority when they want to buy a product. We wrote down all of our information and then created our
                personas.
