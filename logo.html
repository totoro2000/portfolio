        <p class="note">For the logo assignment, I decided to make a logo for a streaming website for movies called
            Mubi. These are
            the first sketches for the logo.
            I draw logos for this company and asked for feedback from my teacher and finally, I chose one to work more
            on it and use Illustrator for the final work.

                In the second week, I designed my logo with Illustrator and I got feedback from my teacher based on his
                comment the logo would be better to be in a single line and more modern items be used in it.
