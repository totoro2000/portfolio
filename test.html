            <em> “Testing phase is when the final solution of a product is tested on a full scale. It helps to evaluate
                whether a solution might or might not work. The prototype that’s considered best after considering the
                feedback from customers and end-users is implemented.”</em><br>
            As we had the Figma prototype and got feedback for it from our client and our teacher, we just need to test
            it with our users.

                <h4>CMD methods:</h4>
            </dd>
            <dd>• Task Analysis: We provide the prototype for our users and asked to do some tasks in our website. I
                used this method because I had all the ingredients for it and finally find the users that can do the
                test with them and all of them were interested to use these kind of websites.</dd>
            <dd>• Prototyping: I found this phase as an opportunity to fix anything in our Figma prototype that
                could be not suitable for our users or find it difficult to use the website.</dd>

                    <h4>The questions that we had in this phase:</h4>
                </dd>
                <dd>How we can test the website with users?</dd>
                <dd>What are the tasks?</dd>
                <dd>What is our website strengths and weaknesses?</dd>
                <dd> As we finish the prototype we started to test it with our users, but as we did not have access to a
                    large scale of users we just test it with someone that we know, for this phase i test the website
                    with
                    an art student who is interested to buy artworks, and my parents as someone older to see is the
                    website
                    instructions are easy for them to follow or not.</dd>
                <dd>Tasks that I asked from my users to do in this phase:</dd>
                <dd>1. Find a way to know more about artist on the website.</dd>
                <dd>2. See our products page.</dd>
                <dd>3. Earn more information about an specific toy.</dd>
                <dd>4. Try to order the toy.</dd>
                <dd>5. Go back to the home page.</dd>
                <dd>6. Find the contact page.</dd>

                <dd>After the testing all the users found the tasks clear and they did not need further information
                    about them, I asked for any negative point in our website but they found our website as a
                    user-friendly website with simple design and instructions.</dd>

                <dd>
                    <h4>Learning outcomes:</h4>
                </dd>
                <dd>• Interactive media:</dd>
                <dd>Based on what our users think about our website we could change something in it and improve it
                    before to finish coding.I did the user testing with three users and the instruction of the website
                    was clear for them and I asked for the feedback or anything that could be improved in our website
                    but the instruction was all clear for them.</dd>
                <dd>• Communication:</dd>
                <dd>We tried to ask for feedback from our users, the questions was completely clear for them and they
                    did not need more explanation for doing the tasks that we asked.</dd>
                <dd>• Developing:</dd>
                <dd>We started to work on coding, all pages and parts were divided between all members and my tasks was
                    completing the footer and the part which was for introduction about the artist.</dd>
