        <h4>CMD methods</h4>

        <p class="note">The CMD methods that I used for this assignment are literature studies and Observation.
            I used literature studies to find out how we can get used to this extension and when it is necessary to
            be used in a website. An observation method to find out if using this extension is common in online art
            galleries or not. Here are the examples that I used:

            </dd>
            <dd>
                <h4>What is FAQ?</h4>
            </dd>
            <dd>frequently asked questions
                ’ (a list of questions and answers about a particular subject, especially one giving basic information
                to users of a website) [oxford dictionary]
            </dd>
            <dd>
                <h4>Is it common to use FAQ pages on artistic websites? Like portfolios?</h4>
            </dd>
            <dd>For this using or not using this extension I used the observation method and I visited some online
                portfolios of UX designers, painters, and digital artists. All the websites are mentioned above.
                On Keita Yamada’s portfolio, which represents his works just a contact page is created to have contact
                with the designer and ask questions about his working condition and collaboration.
                Punch and Yoshiki Okamura Portfolio were other websites that I visited with the same options as the
                previous one.
                The other website that I visited was ,Revenge pop, with a difference which had a page for comments from
                the artist’s students about the exhibition of their teacher. In my opinion, this option can be helpful
                when you can read a review from a reviewer, retailer, or someone who purchases an artwork and share
                his/her experience about the artist’s work. I visited other website from other artists and none of them
                had a page for FAQ. The only way to gain more information about the artworks and collaboration with the
                artists was email and other social media options- but mostly email.
            </dd>
            <dd>
                <h4>When is necessary to use FAQ pages?</h4>
            </dd>
            <dd>Based on my observation FAQ would be better to use in website which has more interaction with customers
                like online stores, with a bigger target group. Based on our client’s wishes this website should be like
                an online portfolio for one of her latest art projects which targeted people who are interested in art.
                So we are not expected to provide a page to collect user questions about the way that they want to buy
                products or other things like this. All the information about toys and the story behind them and brief
                information will be provided for our users on our website and the way to purchase artwork are explained
                in a simple way and the email will be mentioned in different parts of the website for our users to feel
                free to ask more question if they have.</dd>
            <dd>
                <h4>Conclusion</h4>
            </dd>
            <dd>In conclusion, as we have a small target group and instructions are so simple, the FAQ part would not be
                a good option for an extension on our website. </dd>

        <div class="description-2">
            <h4>Return policy:</h4>
            <p>
                Transparency will save your time and money. Make all essential information, like your return policy,
                prices,
                acceptable payment methods, etc. available in one place. As you sell online, you cannot immediately
                address
                every question, but you can certainly create a list of potential questions with your answers. It’s the
                same
                with a return policy and shipping info. Let your customers know how you deliver purchased goods, how
                much
                they will cost, and on what terms they can return it if they don’t like them.


                <dd> As a group, we are mostly focused on introducing a product to our users and making them aware of a
                    piece
                    of
                    artwork and besides that providing a place to buy those artworks, so currently we are emphasizing
                    showing
                    the artist’s works and then creating a shopping space. In the website that we are going to create we
                    have an
                    about page for products and the artist and a gallery to show the products the buying process is done
                    by
                    email so we do not provide a part for FAQ, knowing other users’ experience after buying the artwork,
                    etc. so
                    I tried to choose this part as an extension for our website.</dd>
            <h4> Questions:</h4>
            <dd>What is a FAQ page?</dd>
            <dd>When is necessary to use this page?</dd>
            <dd>Is it common to use FAQ pages on artistic websites? Like portfolios?</dd>
            <dd>What Is the return policy?</dd>
            <dd>Requirements of the return policy?</dd>
            <dd> How to write a return policy?</dd>
            <h4>What is the return policy?</h4>
            <dd>Return policies are the rules retail merchants establish to manage the process by which customers return
                or exchange unwanted or defective merchandise that they have purchased previously. Return policies are
                an extension of the customer service retailers provide; they tend to be fairly liberal as a consequence.
                For this reason, many consumers believe they can always return merchandise for a full refund regardless
                of the circumstances. In reality, both regular and online merchants enjoy great leeway in establishing
                individual policies. As returns have become more prevalent and more costly, some merchants have imposed
                tighter restrictions on merchandise returns.</dd>
            <h4>Requirements:</h4>
            <dd>If you have requirements that must be met before a return can be processed, you need to let customers
                know ahead of time.
                For example, you may want to stipulate that all returns must be sent unopened and/or in their original
                packaging. You should also let customers know if they need an authorization number, shipping address,
                purchase receipt, etc. Whatever conditions you choose, state them clearly for all to see.
                One simple way to handle this is to use a Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA) system. This allows you
                to request information and images from the customer. If you decide to accept the return, you issue an
                authorization. If your business covers return shipping, you’ll send the customer a shipping label along
                with the authorization.
            </dd>
            <h4>How to write a return policy?</h4>
            <h4>Keep it simple</h4>
            <dd>For writing a good return policy it would be better to keep the language simple and show the process in
                simple, brief steps. Having many stages can make the customer confused and too many explanations, rules,
                and expectations can have the same result.</dd>
            <h4>Disclose any fees associated with returns</h4>
            <dd>When a shopper wants to return an item they’ve purchased in your store, who will cover the cost of
                return shipping, restocking, etc.? Things like this need to be clearly defined in your return policy.
                There's nothing worse, from a consumer's perspective than receiving a product you don't like only to
                find out that you have to pay out of pocket to send it back. Additionally, all the financial
                responsibility for returned items should be included clearly in the policy.</dd>
            <h4>Promote your policy:</h4>
            <dd>A return policy is only as good as its visibility. If no one can find it, then it doesn’t exist, and
                that spells trouble for online owners.
                It’s always a good idea to feature your return policy on the homepage of your website. The footer is a
                popular spot for this and some even like making it a part of the checkout process.
                In addition to homepage placement, we suggest you do the following two things. First, include a printed
                copy of your return policy inside every package you ship. Second, feature your policy inside the
                purchase-confirmation email you send to customers.
            </dd>
            <h4>Conclusion:</h4>
            <dd>To sum up, the return policy could very well be the most-read document on your website. It’s not just a
                way of explaining your return requirements and process, but also a means of making a good impression.
                Personally, I think that this extension should be on our website at the footer maybe or where the user
                can read more about each product and the way that they can purchase them. Not on a separate page. All
                the instructions should be simple and it would be great to show this process and also the buying process
                with simple graphic elements to make the website more interesting and more user-friendly maybe. And that
                part that we have on the footer can be linked to that part that is shown with pictures and graphics.
            </dd>
            <h4>Learning outcomes:</h4>
            <dd>• Professional identity:</dd>
            <dd>I got help from other websites as examples to find out what is suitable for our website and could be
                included, and by referring to them and what our client wants we made choices to not include FAQ page and
                the return policy can be a could have( MSCW list) for our website.</dd>
            <dd>• Research:</dd>
            <dd>I did research about each feature for the extension page to see if they are suitable for our website or
                not.</dd>
