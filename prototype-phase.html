            <em> " A prototype is a product built to test ideas and changes until it resembles the final
                product."</em><br>
            Our main goal for this phase is based on what our client what and users needs we find a acceptable design
            for our website.
        </p>
        <dl>
            <dd>This phase of the project is more familiar for our group members because of our previous experience
                working as a group on designing a website and also in our personal assignments as well.</dd>

            <dd>
            <dd>
                <h4>CMD methods:</h4>
            </dd>
            <dd>Mood board:</dd>
            <dd>I tried to get more information about the Greek ancient culture, the history of the toys, search for
                motifs that used in old Greek building that might be inspiring to use them in our website, and most
                colors that are used in ancient toys, architecture, and sculptures. </dd>
            <dd>Literature study:</dd>
            <dd>I tried to get all information above by visiting museums’ websites, artists online portfolio, and some
                online shops for artworks which are inspired by ancient Greek culture.</dd>
            <dd>
                <h4>Learning outcomes:</h4>
            </dd>
            <dd>• Interactive media</dd>
            <dd>We had the two Figma prototypes and we showed them to our customer and ask for her opinion about each.
                Also, we got feedback from our front-end development teacher and we found out we have to work more on
                our prototype.</dd>
            <dd>• Communication: </dd>
            <dd>By having the meeting with our teacher and our client we tried to improve our prototype that helped us
                in this process to reach the final design.</dd>
            <dd>• Research</dd>
            <dd>Creating the mood board for myself needed research and I got all my information via literature studies
                for this part.</dd>

            <dd>• Professional identity:</dd>
            <dd>We collect all our information to create a website inspired by artist’s work and Greek culture.</dd>
            <dd>• Design:</dd>
            <dd>Working on both paper and Figma prototype to reach the final design.</dd>
            <dd>
                <h4>During theprototype phase I wprked on:</h4>
            </dd>
            <dd>- The final design of the paper prototype.</dd>
            <dd>- The contac page of the Figma prototype and the menu.</dd>
            <h4>References:</h4>
            </dd>
            <dd>For this phase, I started to study the history of the toys that the artist reproduced and visited some
                museum websites, online art galleries, and other artists’ portfolios to have a mindset and create a mood
                board for myself. I shared the websites with other members as well.</dd>
            <dd>These are the website that helps me to gain information about this project:</dd>

            <p>
            <h3>Process and results:</h3>

            <h4> First week:</h4>
            <dd>After the card sorting and ideating phase, we started to work on prototyping, at first, we has different
                sketches and we drew all of them on paper, based on our client and card sorting result we tried to find
                a good design for the website. We didn’t make the decision in the first week because everyone had a
                different idea.
            </dd>

            <dd> <img src="statics/prototype-4.png" alt="first prototype" class="assignment-photo"></dd>
            <dd> <img src="statics/prototype-3.png" alt="first prototype" class="assignment-photo"></dd>
            <dd> <img src="statics/prototype-2.png" alt="first prototype" class="assignment-photo"></dd>
            <dd> <img src="statics/prototype-1.png" alt="first prototype" class="assignment-photo"></dd>
            <dd> <img src="statics/prototype-5.png" alt="first prototype" class="assignment-photo"></dd>
            <h4>Second week:</h4>
            <dd>In the second week, we tried to find the best layout for the page and we finalized our paper prototype.
                We decided to start working on the Figma prototype based on the paper prototype that we all agreed with.
                I worked on the contact page.</dd>

            <dd> <img src="statics/prototype-6.png" alt="first prototype" class="assignment-photo"></dd>
            <dd> <img src="statics/prototype-7.png" alt="first prototype" class="assignment-photo"></dd>
            <h4>Figma:</h4>
            <dd>The Figma design should have been something like the final paper prototype but the design of another
                member for the landing page was not based on what we designed on paper and mostly was based on personal
                ideas and that layout referred to the other pages too. :(</dd>
            <dd> <img src="statics/prototype-8.png" alt="first prototype" class="assignment-photo"></dd>
            <dd>So the group decided to continue with the new layout because we did not have enough time for changing it
                and also to convince everyone for the same template. The only thing that we needed to decide about it
                was the color palette. We arranged a meeting with our client to ask for her opinion on colors. </dd>
            <h4>Final design:</h4>
            <dd>This is our final prototype.Click to see the whole prototype on Figma: </dd>
            <dd> <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/PiP913r7S0LnuAXSXlb8x9/Great-Greek-Love?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&t=Kj1imF9On6mOGSm4-1"
                    target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="assignment-link"><img src="statics/prototype-9.png"
                        alt="first prototype" class="assignment-photo"></a></dd>
            <h4>Feedback:</h4>
            <dd>We got feedback from our FED teacher about the website layout and the whole design was not
                acceptable; also, we were behind the planned time so, for this phase of the project, we did not have a
                good result but because of the lack of time, we had to continue with the current prototype and focus on
                coding to have a functional product.</dd>
