            <em> "Define is the second phase of design thinking, where you define the problem statement in a
                human-centered manner."</em><br>
            Our main goal is to collect all information that we got during the empathize phase and find and define the
            problem and the main needs.
        </p>
        <dl>
            <h4>CMD methods:</h4>
            <dd>• “Requirement list” is a great method to use since once done, it can serve as a planning tool and a
                checklist to ensure that our design meets all demands.</dd>
            <dd>• “Design Pattern search” is also a good method because it can guide us to find common problems and a
                description of the context in which these solutions work best.</dd>
            <dd>• “Test Report” is a way to collect data from conducted tests on surveys etc, and summarise the
                information, show the analysis of that data, and conclude it with lessons learned.</dd>

            <p>For this phase, we had different stages that we divided between members. These are the parts of this
                phase: survey, interviews, user requirements, manifesto, and project details.
                <dd>
                    <h4>My role during the Define phase:</h4>
                </dd>
                <dd>- I produced the transcribed interview with Fenia and the user requirements part.</dd>

                <dd>- I collect all the information from our client, a survey, and an interview that we had with a
                    parent.
                    The result of gathering this data was creating a website that mostly targeted parents and adults
                    with useful information about the history and physical features of each toy and also providing a
                    brief introduction about the artist. The visual features should be simple and elegant at the same
                    time. </dd>
                <dd>The next step for our group is to use all these pieces of information to create a prototype and ask
                    our client’s opinion about it.</dd>
                <dd>
                    <h4>Learing outcomes:</h4>
                </dd>
                <dd>• Research: </dd>
                <dd>For this phase we tried to collect data from our client, target group and via the survey that we
                    created all of these information helped us to have an overall view about the final product.</dd>
                <dd>• Communication: </dd>
                <dd>We tried to have contact with our client ask more about this project from her and also find parents
                    who were interested in these kind of artworks.</dd>
