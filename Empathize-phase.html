            <em> " Empathize is the first phase of design thinking, where you gain real insight into users and their
                needs."</em><br>
            As a group, our main goal for this part is to understand and to know our users’ needs and problems.
        </p>
        <dl>
            <h4>Questions:</h4>
            <dd>1. What is Empathize phase?</dd>
            <dd>2. What should we include in this phase?</dd>
            <dd>3. Which CMD methods are suitable for our case?</dd>
            <dd>4. How to find our target group?</dd>

            <dd>
                <h4>Learning outcomes</h4>
            </dd>
            <dd>• Communication: </dd>
            <dd>In this phase we formed our group and had our first appointment with our client, after the meeting we
                divided tasks and prioritise each task.</dd>
        </dl>





        <div class="description-2">
            <p>
                After forming the group we had the first meeting with our client, we found out about our goal and a
                general look at the final product, something to introduce the artist’s work. We started making the
                questions and subquestions for the project:
            <h4>Main question:</h4>
            <dd>How to create an interesting, playful but professional website where parents/kids/museums can buy, play
                with and find information about handmade recreations of ancient greek toys made by the artist Fenia
                Xatzimixail?</dd>
            <h4>Subquestions:</h4>
            <dd>1. What could make the website interesting and engaging for parents/kids/museums alike? </dd>
            <dd>2. How can we balance the playful and professional look in the website?</dd>
            <dd>3. How can we implement the “play” part?</dd>
            <dd>4. How can we describe, promote and tell the customers about Fenia as an artist?</dd>
            </p>
            <p> For this phase, we decided that the use of the “Expo”, “Participant Observation” and “Survey” CMD
                methods
                would be ideal.
                <dd>We can use the Expo method to see what other people think about our product. Because one thing
                    looked at
                    from different points gives us a better idea of the whole picture of the product.</dd>
                <dd>Participant Observation is also another thing we can use since we can put ourselves in the shoes of
                    our
                    users and ‘test’ our own product which can make us find problems that we couldn’t do beforehand.
                </dd>
                <dd>Surveys are also quite useful since we can have a general understanding of what our target audience
                    likes or would like to have as a product. The survey questions can be tailored to get deeper or more
                    overall information.</dd>


            <h4>Project plan:</h4>
            <p> We started working on the project plan, each team member completed a part of it and some parts were done
                by
                all members.
                <dd>
                    <h4>the parts that I wrote for the project plan:</h4>
                </dd>
                My parts for the project plan were: Goals of the project and Risk analysis.
                <dd>• Challenges:
                <dd>
                <dd>- We had some problems with finishing the project plan on time because most of the team members did
                    not
                    feel well for a week.</dd>
                <dd>- After starting the other phases and works for our project we were not aligned with the initial
                    planning and we had to change the planning part again.</dd>
                <dd>• Creating persona:</dd>
                <dd>Read more about the persona project <a href="persona.html" target="_blank"
                        rel="noopener noreferrer"> <em>here.</em></a></dd>
                <dd>For creating the persona we still did not have enough information so we try to arrange a meeting
                    with our client.
                    We thought about the interview questions and then I did arrangements for a meeting and we conducted
                    the interview a week after. Later she sent us some further information like the photos of the
                    products and some websites to get inspired by. So the needs of our client became clear to us.
                </dd>
                <dd>Thus, we almost achieved the main goal for this phase( but not completely). The next step for our
                    group was thinking about survey questions that targeted adults and mainly parents with children, an
                    interview with an adult, and a museum manager.
